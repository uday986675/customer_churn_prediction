🔮 Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a business) using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior and demographics, the model helps businesses retain customers and build effective marketing strategies.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing & cleaning (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).

Feature engineering (customer activity, contract details, services, etc.).

Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.

Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Insights to improve customer retention strategies.

📦 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

🔧 Usage
# Example: Training the model
python train.py

# Example: Making predictions
python predict.py --input customer_data.csv

📊 Example Workflow

Load customer dataset (e.g., telecom/banking).

Preprocess features (gender, tenure, monthly charges, etc.).

Train machine learning models.

Evaluate and compare performance.

Use best model to predict churn on new data.

📊 Visualization Examples

Churn rate distribution.

Feature importance (e.g., contract type, monthly charges).

Confusion matrix for model performance.

🔍 Use Cases

Telecom companies predicting customer cancellations.

Banks forecasting account closures.

Subscription businesses improving retention.
